Data is a symbolic representation of a feature or property of an entity

<ul>
  <li>It doesn't make sense by itself
    <li> if we process or interpret it, then we have information
      <li>we associate data with something or someone (contextualize)
        <li>In computing, data is represented by a value
          <li>that is, in essence, that data is a value about something.
        </ul>
        
<ul>
  <li><b>Data</b>: a value (about something).
  <li><b>Instruction</b>: it is a single operation that can be performed by the machine.
    <li> Instructions manipulate data.
      <li>Instructions are executed in the order in which they are written, one after another, in sequence.
  <li>The order in which they are executed is commonly called <b>execution flow</b>
    </ul>
    
An algorithm has two large blocks:

<ul>
    <li>algorithm name
    <li><b>Data Declaration</b>
    <li><b>Actions</b>
    <li>end algorithm
    </ul>
