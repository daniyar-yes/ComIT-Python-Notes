Data is a symbolic representation of a feature or property of an entity

<ul>
  <li>It doesn't make sense by itself
    <li> if we process or interpret it, then we have information
      <li>we associate data with something or someone (contextualize)
        <li>In computing, data is represented by a value
          <li>that is, in essence, that data is a value about something.
        </ul>
        
<ul>
  <li><b>Data</b>: a value (about something).
  <li><b>Instruction</b>: it is a single operation that can be performed by the machine.
    <li> Instructions manipulate data.
      <li>Instructions are executed in the order in which they are written, one after another, in sequence.
  <li>The order in which they are executed is commonly called <b>execution flow</b>
    </ul>
    
An algorithm has two large blocks:

<ul>
    <li>algorithm name
    <li><b>Data Declaration</b>
    <li><b>Actions</b>
    <li>end algorithm
    </ul>
    
Variable and constants. Variables can change, constants cannot.

They have name, type and content (value).

  Types of Actions.
  
  The Bohm-Jacopini theorem proves that any algorithm can be described with the three types of actions below.
  
  <ol>
  <li> Sequence: It is a simple operation that runs as a step.
    <li> Selection / Conditional: to make decisions.
      <li> Iteration: They allow to repeat actions under a certain condition or a certain number of times.
        </ol>
        
<b> Sequence </b>
        
Sequence represents a direct operation to be carried out. They are called a sequence because they are executed one after another in a sequential order.

<b>We write one action per line</b>

Different types:

Assignment - operation to give value to a variable from an expression.

Input: operation to enter characters by keyboard.

Output: operations to display characters on the screen.

Algorithm invocation: Sequence can be invoked and act as an action.

Expression: is a combination of operands connected to operators that is evaluated and returns a single value.

X = 2 + 5 is an expression. X is variable, 2 and 5 are operands, + and = are operators.



They are representations of a calculation needed to obtain a result that we want.
