<b>Algorithm</b>

<ul>
 <li> What is the purpose of programming?
 <li>The resolution of computational type problems.
 <li> When is a computational and when not?
 <li> When a computer can do the work to solve the problem. It depends on the context.
  </ul>
  
  The detalization on your instructions depends on the <b>Interlocutor</b> - Interlocutor is any entity (person or object) that can understand a stated method (set of actions) and carry out (Execute it).
  
  <b>Action</b> is a description of something that has to be done and changes the environment.
  
  Not every action can be executed by any interlocutor.
  
  <ul>
   <li>  Primitive actions.
 <li>Non-primitive actions.
   </ul>
   
   <ul>
  <li>  <b>Algorithm</b>: is an ordered sequence of primitive actions oriented to solve a problem or a certain question.
  <li><b>Language</b>: is something that we talk with the interlocutor to describe the algorithms.
   </ul>
   
   Let's make an algorithm to change a burned light bulb:
   
<ol>
  <li> Set the ladder on place
          <li> Take out light bulb
        <li>Install new light bulb
                       <li>Store the ladder
  </ol>
  
  <b>OR</b>
  
   <ol>
  <li> Set the ladder on place
    <li>Climg up ladder
      <li> Take out light bulb
        <li>Set down from the ladder
          <li>Grab the new bulb
            <li>Climg up ladder
              <li>Set up new light bulb
                <li>Step down from the ladder
                  <li>Store the ladder
  </ol>
  
OR one algorithm can be nested in another (steps or the 2nd can be substeps of the first).

Each large step is known by the term <b>module</b>

This is part of <b>modular thinking</b> know as <b>top-down programming philosophy</b>.

<ul>
  <li>It's really all we have at hand to solve a problem when we don't know the detials.

<li>It's not convenient to start with the details, because we can get lost!

<li>We start from the most general information because it is easier for us.

<li>And we go from the most general to the most specific.
</ul>
It looks easy, but it's actually hard.
<ul>
<li>It requires a lot of practice.
<li>It requires creativity.
  </ul>
